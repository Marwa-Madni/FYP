### Overview
In this work, an effort will be made towards developig an efficient deep learning-base COVID-19 diagnostic system using CT images. The project will also investigate the learning capacity of CN models by introducing different new architectural ideas, i.e region and edge, channel boosting and attention-based operation for the diagnosis of COVID-19 pneumonia. Moreover, the research will be directed towards freezing or adding conventional CNN layers and exploiting differnt ideas to improve the COVID-19 diagnosis performcance. Finally, we will try to develop an application for deployment.
